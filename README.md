Software Implementation of an 8-bit Computer following the wonderful book "But How do it know" by J. Clark Scott

# Why

This development is for my personal learning mainly.

#How

I try to implement the components in software. The idea is to have a NAND-Gate as a class which will be "wired up" to form more complex components, those comprising the final "computer".
